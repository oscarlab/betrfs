perf-trace(1)
=============

NAME
----
perf-trace - strace inspired tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf trace'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command will show the events associated with the target, initially
syscalls, but other system events like pagefaults, task lifetime events,
scheduling events, etc.

Initially this is a live mode only tool, but eventually will work with
perf.data files like the other tools, allowing a detached 'record' from
analysis phases.

OPTIONS
-------

--all-cpus::
        System-wide collection from all CPUs.

-p::
--pid=::
	Record events on existing process ID (comma separated list).

--tid=::

--cpu::
Collect samples only on the list of CPUs provided. Multiple CPUs can be provided as a

In per-thread mode with inheritance mode on (default), Events are captured only when
the thread executes on the designated CPUs. Default is to monitor all CPUs.
