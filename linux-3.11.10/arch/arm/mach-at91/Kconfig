	  Select this if you want Suspend-to-RAM to save the most power

	  When only that slow-clock is available, some peripherals lose
	  functionality.  Many can't issue wakeup events unless faster
	  clocks are available.  Some lose their operating state and

       help
	  On AT91rm9200 chips where you're using a system clock derived
	  from the 32768 Hz hardware clock, this tick rate should divide
	  it exactly: use a power-of-two value, such as 128 or 256, to
	  reduce timing errors caused by rounding.

	  On AT91sam926x chips, or otherwise when using a higher precision
	  system clock (of at least several MHz), rounding is less of a
	  problem so it can be safer to use a decimal values like 100.
