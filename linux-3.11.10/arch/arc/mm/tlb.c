 * vineetg: Aug 2011
 *  -Reintroduce duplicate PD fixup - some customer chips still have the issue
 *
 * vineetg: May 2011
 *  -No need to flush_cache_page( ) for each call to update_mmu_cache()
 *   some of the LMBench tests improved amazingly
 *      = page-fault thrice as fast (75 usec to 28 usec)
 *      = mmap twice as fast (9.6 msec to 4.6 msec),
 *      = fork (5.3 msec to 3.7 msec)
 *
 * vineetg: April 2011 :
 *  -MMU v3: PD{0,1} bits layout changed: They don't overlap anymore,
 *      helps avoid a shift when preparing PD0 from PTE
 *
 * vineetg: April 2011 : Preparing for MMU V3
 *  -MMU v2/v3 BCRs decoded differently
 *  -Remove TLB_SIZE hardcoding as it's variable now: 256 or 512
 *  -tlb_entry_erase( ) can be void
 *  -local_flush_tlb_range( ):
 *      = need not "ceil" @end
 *      = walks MMU only if range spans < 32 entries, as opposed to 256
 *
 * Vineetg: Sept 10th 2008
 *  -Changes related to MMU v2 (Rel 4.8)
 *
 * Vineetg: Aug 29th 2008
 *  -In TLB Flush operations (Metal Fix MMU) there is a explict command to
 *    flush Micro-TLBS. If TLB Index Reg is invalid prior to TLBIVUTLB cmd,
 *    it fails. Thus need to load it with ANY valid value before invoking
 *    TLBIVUTLB cmd
 *
 * Vineetg: Aug 21th 2008:
 *  -Reduced the duration of IRQ lockouts in TLB Flush routines
 *  -Multiple copies of TLB erase code seperated into a "single" function
 *  -In TLB Flush routines, interrupt disabling moved UP to retrieve ASID
 *       in interrupt-safe region.
 *
 * Vineetg: April 23rd Bug #93131
 *    Problem: tlb_flush_kernel_range() doesnt do anything if the range to
 *              flush is more than the size of TLB itself.

/*			Need for ARC MMU v2
 *
 * ARC700 MMU-v1 had a Joint-TLB for Code and Data and is 2 way set-assoc.
 * For a memcpy operation with 3 players (src/dst/code) such that all 3 pages
 * map into same set, there would be contention for the 2 ways causing severe
 * Thrashing.
 *
 * Although J-TLB is 2 way set assoc, ARC700 caches J-TLB into uTLBS which has
 * much higher associativity. u-D-TLB is 8 ways, u-I-TLB is 4 ways.
 * Given this, the thrasing problem should never happen because once the 3
 * J-TLB entries are created (even though 3rd will knock out one of the prev
 * two), the u-D-TLB and u-I-TLB will have what is required to accomplish memcpy
 *
 * Yet we still see the Thrashing because a J-TLB Write cause flush of u-TLBs.
 * This is a simple design for keeping them in sync. So what do we do?
 * The solution which James came up was pretty neat. It utilised the assoc
 * of uTLBs by not invalidating always but only when absolutely necessary.
 *
 * - Existing TLB commands work as before
 * - New command (TLBWriteNI) for TLB write without clearing uTLBs
 * - New command (TLBIVUTLB) to invalidate uTLBs.
 *
 * The uTLBs need only be invalidated when pages are being removed from the
 * OS page table. If a 'victim' TLB entry is being overwritten in the main TLB
 * as a result of a miss, the removed entry is still allowed to exist in the
 * uTLBs as it is still valid and present in the OS page table. This allows the
 * full associativity of the uTLBs to hide the limited associativity of the main
 * TLB.
 *
 * During a miss handler, the new "TLBWriteNI" command is used to load
 * entries without clearing the uTLBs.
 *
 * When the OS page table is updated, TLB entries that may be associated with a
 * removed page are removed (flushed) from the TLB using TLBWrite. In this
 * circumstance, the uTLBs must also be cleared. This is done by using the
 * existing TLBWrite command. An explicit IVUTLB is also required for those
 * corner cases when TLBWrite was not executed at all because the corresp
 * J-TLB entry got evicted/replaced.
