Description:
		The /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/oled*_img files control
		OLED mocro displays on Intuos4 Wireless tablet. Accepted image
		has to contain 256 bytes (64x32 px 1 bit colour). The format
		is the same as PBM image 62x32px without header (64 bits per
		horizontal line, 32 lines). An example of setting OLED No. 0:
		dd bs=256 count=1 if=img_file of=[path to oled0_img]/oled0_img
		The attribute is read only and no local copy of the image is
		stored.

Description:
		The /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/speed file controls
		reporting speed of Wacom bluetooth tablet. Reading from
		this file returns 1 if tablet reports in high speed mode
		or 0 otherwise. Writing to this file one of these values
		switches reporting speed.

Description:
		Attribute group for control of the status LEDs and the OLEDs.
		This attribute group is only available for Intuos 4 M, L,
		and XL (with LEDs and OLEDs), Intuos 5 (LEDs only), and Cintiq
		21UX2 and Cintiq 24HD (LEDs only). Therefore its presence
		implicitly signifies the presence of said LEDs and OLEDs on the
		tablet device.

Description:
		Writing to this file sets the status LED luminance (1..127)
		when the stylus does not touch the tablet surface, and no
		button is pressed on the stylus. This luminance level is
		normally lower than the level when a button is pressed.

Description:
		When writing a 1024 byte raw image in Wacom Intuos 4
		interleaving format to the file, the image shows up on Button N
		of the device. The image is a 64x32 pixel 4-bit gray image. The
		1024 byte binary is split up into 16x 64 byte chunks. Each 64
		byte chunk encodes the image data for two consecutive lines on
		the display. The low nibble of each byte contains the first
		line, and the high nibble contains the second line.
