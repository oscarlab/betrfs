Description:
		This file contains the enumerated host ID for the Intel
		SCU controller. The Intel(R) C600 Series Chipset SATA/SAS
		Storage Control Unit embeds up to two 4-port controllers in
		a single PCI device.  The controllers are enumerated in order
		which usually means the lowest number scsi_host corresponds
		with the first controller, but this association is not
		guaranteed.  The 'isci_id' attribute unambiguously identifies
		the controller index: '0' for the first controller,
		'1' for the second.
