Description
-----------

The LM95245 is an 11-bit digital temperature sensor with a 2-wire System
Management Bus (SMBus) interface and TruTherm technology that can monitor
the temperature of a remote diode as well as its own temperature.
The LM95245 can be used to very accurately monitor the temperature of
external devices such as microprocessors.

All temperature values are given in millidegrees Celsius. Local temperature
is given within a range of -127 to +127.875 degrees. Remote temperatures are
given within a range of -127 to +255 degrees. Resolution depends on
temperature input and range.

Each sensor has its own critical limit, but the hysteresis is common to all
two channels.

The lm95245 driver can change its update interval to a fixed set of values.
It will round up to the next selectable interval. See the datasheet for exact
values. Reading sensor values more often will do no harm, but will return
'old' values.
