ARM Integrator/AP (Application Platform) and Integrator/CP (Compact Platform)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARM's oldest Linux-supported platform with connectors for different core
tiles of ARMv4, ARMv5 and ARMv6 type.

Required properties (in root node):
	compatible = "arm,integrator-ap";  /* Application Platform */
	compatible = "arm,integrator-cp";  /* Compact Platform */

FPGA type interrupt controllers, see the versatile-fpga-irq binding doc.

In the root node the Integrator/CP must have a /cpcon node pointing
to the CP control registers, and the Integrator/AP must have a
/syscon node pointing to the Integrator/AP system controller.


ARM Versatile Application and Platform Baseboards
-------------------------------------------------
ARM's development hardware platform with connectors for customizable
core tiles.  The hardware configuration of the Versatile boards is
highly customizable.

Required properties (in root node):
	compatible = "arm,versatile-ab";  /* Application baseboard */
	compatible = "arm,versatile-pb";  /* Platform baseboard */

Interrupt controllers:
- VIC required properties:
	compatible = "arm,versatile-vic";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

- SIC required properties:
	compatible = "arm,versatile-sic";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
