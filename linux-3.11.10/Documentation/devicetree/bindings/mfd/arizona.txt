Wolfson Arizona class audio SoCs

These devices are audio SoCs with extensive digital capabilites and a range
of analogue I/O.

Required properties:

  - compatible : one of the following chip-specific strings:
	"wlf,wm5102"
	"wlf,wm5110"
  - reg : I2C slave address when connected using I2C, chip select number when
    using SPI.

  - interrupts : The interrupt line the /IRQ signal for the device is
    connected to.
  - interrupt-controller : Arizona class devices contain interrupt controllers
    and may provide interrupt services to other devices.
  - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to describe an IRQ, this should be 2.
    The first cell is the IRQ number.
    The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupts.txt

  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).

  - AVDD1-supply, DBVDD1-supply, DBVDD2-supply, DBVDD3-supply, CPVDD-supply,
    SPKVDDL-supply, SPKVDDR-supply : power supplies for the device, as covered
    in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Optional properties:

  - wlf,reset : GPIO specifier for the GPIO controlling /RESET
  - wlf,ldoena : GPIO specifier for the GPIO controlling LDOENA

  - wlf,gpio-defaults : A list of GPIO configuration register values. If
    absent, no configuration of these registers is performed. If any
    entry has a value that is out of range for a 16 bit register then
    the chip default will be used.  If present exactly five values must
    be specified.

Example:

codec: wm5102@1a {
	compatible = "wlf,wm5102";
	reg = <0x1a>;
	interrupts = <347>;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gic>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	wlf,gpio-defaults = <
		0x00000000, /* AIF1TXLRCLK */
		0xffffffff,
		0xffffffff,
		0xffffffff,
		0xffffffff,
	>;
};
