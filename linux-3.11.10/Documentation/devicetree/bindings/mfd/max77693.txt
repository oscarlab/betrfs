Maxim MAX77693 multi-function device

MAX77693 is a Multifunction device with the following submodules:
- PMIC,
- CHARGER,
- LED,
- MUIC,
- HAPTIC

It is interfaced to host controller using i2c.
This document describes the bindings for the mfd device.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77693".
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent :  The parent interrupt controller.

Optional properties:
- regulators : The regulators of max77693 have to be instantiated under subnod
  named "regulators" using the following format.

	regulators {
		regualtor-compatible = ESAFEOUT1/ESAFEOUT2/CHARGER
		standard regulator constratints[*].
	};

	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Example:
	max77693@66 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77693";
		reg = <0x66>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpx1>;
		interrupts = <5 2>;

		regulators {
			esafeout@1 {
				regulator-compatible = "ESAFEOUT1";
				regulator-name = "ESAFEOUT1";
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
			esafeout@2 {
				regulator-compatible = "ESAFEOUT2";
				regulator-name = "ESAFEOUT2";
				};
			charger@0 {
				regulator-compatible = "CHARGER";
				regulator-name = "CHARGER";
				regulator-min-microamp = <60000>;
				regulator-max-microamp = <2580000>;
					regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};
	};
