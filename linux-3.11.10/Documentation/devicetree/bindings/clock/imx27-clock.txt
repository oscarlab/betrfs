* Clock bindings for Freescale i.MX27

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx27-ccm"
- reg: Address and length of the register set
- interrupts: Should contain CCM interrupt
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.  The following is a full list of i.MX27
clocks and IDs.
