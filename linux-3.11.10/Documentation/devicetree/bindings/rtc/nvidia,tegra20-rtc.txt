NVIDIA Tegra20 real-time clock

The Tegra RTC maintains seconds and milliseconds counters, and five alarm
registers. The alarms and other interrupts may wake the system from low-power
state.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "nvidia,tegra20-rtc".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : A single interrupt specifier.

Example:

timer {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-rtc";
	reg = <0x7000e000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <0 2 0x04>;
};
