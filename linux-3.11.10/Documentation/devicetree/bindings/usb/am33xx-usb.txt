AM33XX MUSB GLUE
 - compatible : Should be "ti,musb-am33xx"
 - reg : offset and length of register sets, first usbss, then for musb instances
 - interrupts : usbss, musb instance interrupts in order
 - ti,hwmods : must be "usb_otg_hs"
 - multipoint : Should be "1" indicating the musb controller supports
   multipoint. This is a MUSB configuration-specific setting.
 - num-eps : Specifies the number of endpoints. This is also a
   MUSB configuration-specific setting. Should be set to "16"
 - ram-bits : Specifies the ram address size. Should be set to "12"
 - port0-mode : Should be "3" to represent OTG. "1" signifies HOST and "2"
   represents PERIPHERAL.
 - port1-mode : Should be "1" to represent HOST. "3" signifies OTG and "2"
   represents PERIPHERAL.
 - power : Should be "250". This signifies the controller can supply up to
   500mA when operating in host mode.

Example:

usb@47400000  {
	compatible = "ti,musb-am33xx";
	reg = <0x47400000 0x1000	/* usbss */
	       0x47401000 0x800		/* musb instance 0 */
	       0x47401800 0x800>;	/* musb instance 1 */
	interrupts = <17		/* usbss */
		      18		/* musb instance 0 */
		      19>;		/* musb instance 1 */
	multipoint = <1>;
	num-eps = <16>;
	ram-bits = <12>;
	port0-mode = <3>;
	port1-mode = <3>;
	power = <250>;
	ti,hwmods = "usb_otg_hs";
};
