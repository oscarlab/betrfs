* AHCI SATA Controller

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
Each SATA controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "calxeda,hb-ahci" or "snps,spear-ahci"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Optional properties:
- calxeda,port-phys: phandle-combophy and lane assignment, which maps each
			SATA port to a combophy and a lane within that
			combophy
- calxeda,sgpio-gpio: phandle-gpio bank, bit offset, and default on or off,
			which indicates that the driver supports SGPIO
			indicator lights using the indicated GPIOs
- calxeda,led-order : a u32 array that map port numbers to offsets within the
			SGPIO bitstream.
- dma-coherent      : Present if dma operations are coherent

Example:
        sata@ffe08000 {
		compatible = "calxeda,hb-ahci";
                reg = <0xffe08000 0x1000>;
                interrupts = <115>;
		calxeda,port-phys = <&combophy5 0 &combophy0 0 &combophy0 1
					&combophy0 2 &combophy0 3>;

        };
