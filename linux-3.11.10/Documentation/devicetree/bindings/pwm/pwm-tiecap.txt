TI SOC ECAP based APWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "ti,<soc>-ecap".
  for am33xx - compatible = "ti,am33xx-ecap";
  for da850  - compatible = "ti,da850-ecap", "ti,am33xx-ecap";
- #pwm-cells: Should be 3. Number of cells being used to specify PWM property.
  First cell specifies the per-chip index of the PWM to use, the second
  cell is the period in nanoseconds and bit 0 in the third cell is used to
  encode the polarity of PWM output. Set bit 0 of the third in PWM specifier
  to 1 for inverse polarity & set to 0 for normal polarity.
- reg: physical base address and size of the registers map.

Optional properties:
- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated to the ECAP:
  "ecap<x>", <x> being the 0-based instance number from the HW spec

Example:

ecap0: ecap@0 { /* ECAP on am33xx */
	compatible = "ti,am33xx-ecap";
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
	reg = <0x48300100 0x80>;
	ti,hwmods = "ecap0";
};

ecap0: ecap@0 { /* ECAP on da850 */
	compatible = "ti,da850-ecap", "ti,am33xx-ecap";
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
	reg = <0x306000 0x80>;
};
