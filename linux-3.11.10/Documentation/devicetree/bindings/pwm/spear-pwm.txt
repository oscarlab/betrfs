== ST SPEAr SoC PWM controller ==

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
  - "st,spear320-pwm"
  - "st,spear1340-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: number of cells used to specify PWM which is fixed to 2 on
  SPEAr. The first cell specifies the per-chip index of the PWM to use and
  the second cell is the period in nanoseconds.

Example:

        pwm: pwm@a8000000 {
            compatible ="st,spear320-pwm";
            reg = <0xa8000000 0x1000>;
            #pwm-cells = <2>;
        };
