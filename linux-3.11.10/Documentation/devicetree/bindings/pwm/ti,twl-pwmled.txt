Texas Instruments TWL series PWM drivers connected to LED terminals

Supported PWMs:
On TWL4030 series: PWMA and PWMB (connected to LEDA and LEDB terminals)
On TWL6030 series: LED PWM (mainly used as charging indicator LED)

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,twl4030-pwmled" or "ti,twl6030-pwmled"
- #pwm-cells: should be 2.  The first cell specifies the per-chip index
  of the PWM to use and the second cell is the period in nanoseconds.

Example:

twl_pwmled: pwmled {
	compatible = "ti,twl6030-pwmled";
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
};
