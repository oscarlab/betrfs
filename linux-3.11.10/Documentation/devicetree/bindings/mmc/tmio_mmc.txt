* Toshiba Mobile IO SD/MMC controller

The tmio-mmc driver doesn't probe its devices actively, instead its binding to
devices is managed by either MFD drivers or by the sh_mobile_sdhi platform
driver. Those drivers supply the tmio-mmc driver with platform data, that either
describe hardware capabilities, known to them, or are obtained by them from
their own platform data or from their DT information. In the latter case all
compulsory and any optional properties, common to all SD/MMC drivers, as
described in mmc.txt, can be used. Additionally the following tmio_mmc-specific
optional bindings can be used.

Optional properties:
- toshiba,mmc-wrprotect-disable: write-protect detection is unavailable

When used with Renesas SDHI hardware, the following compatibility strings
configure various model-specific properties:

"renesas,sh7372-sdhi":	(default) compatible with SH7372
"renesas,r8a7740-sdhi":	compatible with R8A7740: certain MMC/SD commands have to
			wait for the interface to become idle.
