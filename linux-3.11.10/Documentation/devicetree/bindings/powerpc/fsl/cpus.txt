Power Architecture CPU Binding
Copyright 2013 Freescale Semiconductor Inc.

Power Architecture CPUs in Freescale SOCs are represented in device trees as
per the definition in ePAPR.

In addition to the ePAPR definitions, the properties defined below may be
present on CPU nodes.

PROPERTIES

   - fsl,eref-*
        Usage: optional
        Value type: <empty>
        Definition: The EREF (EREF: A Programmer.s Reference Manual for
	Freescale Power Architecture) defines the architecture for Freescale
	Power CPUs.  The EREF defines some architecture categories not defined
	by the Power ISA.  For these EREF-specific categories, the existence of
	a property named fsl,eref-[CAT], where [CAT] is the abbreviated category
	name with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase, indicates that
	the category is supported by the implementation.
