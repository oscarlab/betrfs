Device-Tree bindings for Samsung SoC display controller (FIMD)

FIMD (Fully Interactive Mobile Display) is the Display Controller for the
Samsung series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
buffer to an external LCD interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"samsung,s3c2443-fimd"; /* for S3C24XX SoCs */
		"samsung,s3c6400-fimd"; /* for S3C64XX SoCs */
		"samsung,s5p6440-fimd"; /* for S5P64X0 SoCs */
		"samsung,s5pc100-fimd"; /* for S5PC100 SoC  */
		"samsung,s5pv210-fimd"; /* for S5PV210 SoC */
		"samsung,exynos4210-fimd"; /* for Exynos4 SoCs */
		"samsung,exynos5250-fimd"; /* for Exynos5 SoCs */

- reg: physical base address and length of the FIMD registers set.

- interrupt-parent: should be the phandle of the fimd controller's
		parent interrupt controller.

- interrupts: should contain a list of all FIMD IP block interrupts in the
		 order: FIFO Level, VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

- interrupt-names: should contain the interrupt names: "fifo", "vsync",
	"lcd_sys", in the same order as they were listed in the interrupts
        property.

- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.

- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
         clock-names property.

- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
               property. Must contain "sclk_fimd" and "fimd".

Optional Properties:
- samsung,power-domain: a phandle to FIMD power domain node.

Example:

SoC specific DT entry:

	fimd@11c00000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-fimd";
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		reg = <0x11c00000 0x20000>;
		interrupt-names = "fifo", "vsync", "lcd_sys";
		interrupts = <11 0>, <11 1>, <11 2>;
		clocks = <&clock 140>, <&clock 283>;
		clock-names = "sclk_fimd", "fimd";
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_lcd0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

Board specific DT entry:

	fimd@11c00000 {
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcd_clk &lcd_data24 &pwm1_out>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		status = "okay";
	};
