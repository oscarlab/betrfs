NVIDIA Tegra30 timer

The Tegra30 timer provides ten 29-bit timer channels, a single 32-bit free
running counter, and 5 watchdog modules. The first two channels may also
trigger a legacy watchdog reset.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "nvidia,tegra30-timer", "nvidia,tegra20-timer".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : A list of 6 interrupts; one per each of timer channels 1
    through 5, and one for the shared interrupt for the remaining channels.

timer {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-timer", "nvidia,tegra20-timer";
	reg = <0x60005000 0x400>;
	interrupts = <0 0 0x04
		      0 1 0x04
		      0 41 0x04
		      0 42 0x04
		      0 121 0x04
		      0 122 0x04>;
};
