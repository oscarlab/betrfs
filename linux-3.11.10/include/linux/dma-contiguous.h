/*
 * Contiguous Memory Allocator
 *
 *   The Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) makes it possible to
 *   allocate big contiguous chunks of memory after the system has
 *   booted.
 *
 * Why is it needed?
 *
 *   Various devices on embedded systems have no scatter-getter and/or
 *   IO map support and require contiguous blocks of memory to
 *   operate.  They include devices such as cameras, hardware video
 *   coders, etc.
 *
 *   Such devices often require big memory buffers (a full HD frame
 *   is, for instance, more then 2 mega pixels large, i.e. more than 6
 *   MB of memory), which makes mechanisms such as kmalloc() or
 *   alloc_page() ineffective.
 *
 *   At the same time, a solution where a big memory region is
 *   reserved for a device is suboptimal since often more memory is
 *   reserved then strictly required and, moreover, the memory is
 *   inaccessible to page system even if device drivers don't use it.
 *
 *   CMA tries to solve this issue by operating on memory regions
 *   where only movable pages can be allocated from.  This way, kernel
 *   can use the memory for pagecache and when device driver requests
 *   it, allocated pages can be migrated.
 *
 * Driver usage
 *
 *   CMA should not be used by the device drivers directly. It is
 *   only a helper framework for dma-mapping subsystem.
 *
 *   For more information, see kernel-docs in drivers/base/dma-contiguous.c
