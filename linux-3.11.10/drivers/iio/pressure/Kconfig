	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics pressures:
	  LPS331AP.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, will be created
	  these modules:
	  - st_pressure (core functions for the driver [it is mandatory]);
	  - st_pressure_i2c (necessary for the I2C devices [optional*]);
	  - st_pressure_spi (necessary for the SPI devices [optional*]);

	  (*) one of these is necessary to do something.
