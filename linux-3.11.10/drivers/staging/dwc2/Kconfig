config USB_DWC2
	tristate "DesignWare USB2 DRD Core Support"
	depends on USB
	depends on VIRT_TO_BUS
	help
	  Say Y or M here if your system has a Dual Role HighSpeed
	  USB controller based on the DesignWare HSOTG IP Core.

	  If you choose to build this driver as dynamically linked
	  modules, the core module will be called dwc2.ko, the
	  PCI bus interface module (if you have a PCI bus system)
	  will be called dwc2_pci.ko and the platform interface module
	  (for controllers directly connected to the CPU) will be called
	  dwc2_platform.ko.

	  NOTE: This driver at present only implements the Host mode
	  of the controller. The existing s3c-hsotg driver supports
	  Peripheral mode, but only for the Samsung S3C platforms.
	  There are plans to merge the s3c-hsotg driver with this
	  driver in the near future to create a dual-role driver.

	default y
	help
	  Say N here to disable (verbose) debugging messages to be
	  logged for periodic transfers. This allows better debugging of
	  non-periodic transfers, but of course the debug logs will be
	  incomplete. Note that this also disables some debug messages
	  for which the transfer type cannot be deduced.
