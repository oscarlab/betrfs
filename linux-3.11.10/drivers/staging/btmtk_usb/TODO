TODO:
        - checkpatch.pl clean
	- determine if the driver should not be using a duplicate
          version of the usb-bluetooth interface code, but should
          be merged into the drivers/bluetooth/ directory and
          infrastructure instead.
	- review by the bluetooth developer community

Please send any patches for this driver to Yu-Chen, Cho <acho@suse.com> and
