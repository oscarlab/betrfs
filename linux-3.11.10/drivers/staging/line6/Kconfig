	help
	  Say Y here to add code to measure the impulse response of a Line6
	  device. This is more accurate than user-space methods since it
	  bypasses any PCM data buffering (e.g., by ALSA or jack). This is
	  useful for assessing the performance of new devices, but is not
	  required for normal operation.

	  If unsure, say N.
