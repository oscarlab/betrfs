TODO:
	- checkpatch.pl clean
	- sparse clean
	- determine if the driver should not be using a duplicate
	  version of the usb-storage scsi interface code, but should
	  be merged into the drivers/usb/storage/ directory and
	  infrastructure instead.
	- review by the USB developer community
	- smcommon.h & smilsub.c: use kernel hweight8(), hweight16()

Please send any patches for this driver to Al Cho <acho@novell.com> and
Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>.
