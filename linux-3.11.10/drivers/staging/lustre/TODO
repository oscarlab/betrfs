* Possible remaining coding style fix.
* Remove deadcode.
* Seperate client/server functionality. Functions only used by server can be
  removed from client.
* Clean up libcfs layer. Ideally we can remove include/linux/libcfs entirely.
* Clean up CLIO layer. Lustre client readahead/writeback control needs to better
  suit kernel providings.
* Add documents in Documentation.
* Other minor misc cleanups...
