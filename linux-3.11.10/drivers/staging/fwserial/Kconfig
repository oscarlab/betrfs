       depends on FIREWIRE && TTY
       help
          This enables TTY over IEEE 1394, providing high-speed serial
	  connectivity to cabled peers. This driver implements a
	  ad-hoc transport protocol and is currently limited to
	  Linux-to-Linux communication.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  the module will
	  be called firewire-serial.
