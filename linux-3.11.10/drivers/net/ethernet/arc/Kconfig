	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about ARC cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_ARC

config ARC_EMAC
	tristate "ARC EMAC support"
	select MII
	select PHYLIB
	depends on OF_IRQ
	depends on OF_NET
	---help---
	  On some legacy ARC (Synopsys) FPGA boards such as ARCAngel4/ML50x
	  non-standard on-chip ethernet device ARC EMAC 10/100 is used.
	  Say Y here if you have such a board.  If unsure, say N.
