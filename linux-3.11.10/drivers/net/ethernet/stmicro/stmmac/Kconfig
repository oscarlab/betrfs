config STMMAC_PLATFORM
	bool "STMMAC Platform bus support"
	depends on STMMAC_ETH
	default y
	---help---
	  This selects the platform specific bus support for
	  the stmmac device driver. This is the driver used
	  on many embedded STM platforms based on ARM and SuperH
	  processors.
	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config STMMAC_PCI
	bool "STMMAC PCI bus support"
	depends on STMMAC_ETH && PCI
	---help---
	  This is to select the Synopsys DWMAC available on PCI devices,
	  if you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  This PCI support is tested on XLINX XC2V3000 FF1152AMT0221
	  D1215994A VIRTEX FPGA board.

	  If unsure, say N.

config STMMAC_DEBUG_FS
	bool "Enable monitoring via sysFS "
	default n
	depends on STMMAC_ETH && DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  The stmmac entry in /sys reports DMA TX/RX rings
	  or (if supported) the HW cap register.

config STMMAC_DA
	bool "STMMAC DMA arbitration scheme"
	default n
	---help---
	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).
