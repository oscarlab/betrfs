    // To fix #3522, we need to remember the pivots that we have searched unsuccessfully.
    // For example, when searching right (left), we call search->compare() on the ith pivot key.  If search->compare(0 returns
    //  nonzero, then we search the ith subtree.  If that subsearch returns DB_NOTFOUND then maybe the key isn't present in the
    //  tree.  But maybe we are doing a DB_NEXT (DB_PREV), and everything was deleted.  So we remember the pivot, and later we
    //  will only search subtrees which contain keys that are bigger than (less than) the pivot.
    // The code is a kludge (even before this fix), and interacts strangely with the TOKUDB_FOUND_BUT_REJECTED (which is there
    //  because a failed DB_GET we would keep searching the rest of the tree).  We probably should write the various lookup
    //  codes (NEXT, PREV, CURRENT, etc) more directly, and we should probably use a binary search within a node to search the
    //  pivots so that we can support a larger fanout.
    // These changes (3312+3522) also (probably) introduce an isolation error (#3529).
    //  We must make sure we lock the right range for proper isolation level.
    //  There's probably a bug in which the following could happen.
    //      Thread A:  Searches through deleted keys A,B,D,E and finds nothing, so searches the next leaf, releasing the YDB lock.
    //      Thread B:  Inserts key C, and acquires the write lock, then commits.
    //      Thread A:  Resumes, searching F,G,H and return success.  Thread A then read-locks the range A-H, and doesn't notice
    //        the value C inserted by thread B.  Thus a failure of serialization.
    //     See #3529.
    // There also remains a potential thrashing problem.  When we get a TOKUDB_TRY_AGAIN, we unpin everything.  There's
    //   no guarantee that we will get everything pinned again.  We ought to keep nodes pinned when we retry, except that on the
    //   way out with a DB_NOTFOUND we ought to unpin those nodes.  See #3528.
