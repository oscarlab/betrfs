This directory contains scripts to generate and use virtual disk
images for testing ftfs in qemu-kvm.

./genUbuntudisk.sh

should create two disk images:
   linuxdisk.raw
   ftfs-southbound.raw

Once that script is run, you have set up your 'linuxdisk.raw' virtual
disk by checking out the ft-index repo. Instructions to do this are
elsewhere, including the wiki. However, you will want to then edit the
'.git/config' file to point to your local repository instead.

Once your virtual disk's repo is set up, update
'local-repo-params.include' with that information.

Then each time you make changes to your code locally, you can commit
it, and run ./pullit.sh to pull the changes onto your virtual disk to
test. Once the tests pass, then you can push your changes from your
local repo to the remote.
