  CLAIMS.  This grant does not include claims that would be infringed
  only as a consequence of further modifications of THIS
  IMPLEMENTATION.  If you or your agent or licensee institute or order
  or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  THIS IMPLEMENTATION constitutes direct or contributory patent

 * Caller allocates mempool struct as convenient for caller, but memory used for data storage

 * Caller dynamically allocates memory for mempool and initializes mempool by calling toku_mempool_init().
 * Once a buffer is assigned to a mempool (via toku_mempool_init()), the mempool owns it and
 * is responsible for destroying it when the mempool is destroyed.
 * Caller destroys mempool by calling toku_mempool_destroy().
