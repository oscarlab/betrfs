You need to configure some parameters to lmbench.  Once you have configured
these parameters, you may do multiple runs by saying

	"make rerun"

in the src subdirectory.

NOTICE: please do not have any other activity on the system if you can
help it.  Things like the second hand on your xclock or X perfmeters
are not so good when benchmarking.  In fact, X is not so good when
benchmarking.

needs a second process to send data down the pipe to be read

three attendent child processes sending data down the pipes and 
three benchmark processes reading data and doing the measurements.

lmbench measures a wide variety of system performance, and the full suite
of benchmarks can take a long time on some platforms.  Consequently, we
offer the capability to run only predefined subsets of benchmarks, one
for operating system specific benchmarks and one for hardware specific
benchmarks.  We also offer the option of running only selected benchmarks
which is useful during operating system development.

Please remember that if you intend to publish the results you either need
to do a full run or one of the predefined OS or hardware subsets.
