Description: Hard drive benchmark suite
  Based on the old Bonnie benchmark, Bonnie++ is a toolkit for testing
  hard drive and file system performance.
  .
  As well as bonnie++ itself and some output filters, the suite provides
  some other benchmarking tools including zcav, which can compare the
  raw-read performance of different zones on a drive, and gives output
  suitable for gnuplot.
