bonnie++ (1.97.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed the changelog and aim it at unstable not wheezy.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri, 23 Nov 2012 20:12:46 +1100

bonnie++ (1.97) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a CSV column alignment bug in the case where -s0 is used.  Bump the
    data format version to 1.97.  Thanks to Brian Keefer for reporting this.
    Also added the concurrency and seed fields to the header.
    Closes: #660564, #669124
  * Use a const pointer for the large file test.
  * zcav.8 documents the maximum value of -s
  * Made the zcav deefault block size 512M to cope with new disks that can
    sustain >200MB/s.  Also documented this.
  * Made zcav not SEGV when the -c option is used.
    Closes: #687668
  * Describe the units for the plain text output in bonnie++.8.
    Closes: #643821
  * Removed the outdated section in the description which referred to Lenny.
    Closes: #693483
  * Fixed most of the HTML validation errors in the output of bon_csv2html.

bonnie++ (1.96) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a minor bug in setting the GID.
  * Make it build on Solaris by checking for O_DIRECT being defined.
  * The option -n9765 or greater caused the small file test to abort,
    to increase this I changed the number format to hexadecimal and made it
    10 digits.  Now any option smaller than -n1073741824 will be OK.
    Thanks Nick Dokos of HP.
  * Updated bon_csv2html, made the machine name span two rows, made the
    concurrency column go away when there's no data, correctly calculated the
    colors of the speed columns (was off by one column before), and calculate
    the CPU colors.

bonnie++ (1.95) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed code for building on OS/2, I think that no-one has been interested
    in this for a while.
  * Removed code for building on NT, I don't think that anyone was ever very
    interested in that and it probably didn't work.
  * Patch from Justin Clift to make getc_putc compile on RHEL 5.2.
  * Added the -D option to bonnie++ to use direct IO (O_DIRECT) for bulk IO.
    Thanks to Dave Murch from Violin Memory - http://violin-memory.com/
  * Fixed some more warnings with recent versions of GCC.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 31 Dec 2008 08:50:06 +1100

bonnie++ (1.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typos in man page.
    Closes: #133714, #449596
  * Added the URL to the man pages.
  * Documented why UID==0 is bad.
    Closes: #182023
  * Check return value of chdir()
  * Removed the zcav -s option which did the same thing as -n.
  * Made zcav report in GiB and MiB/s, and made the default 256MiB.
  * Improved bonnie++.8 documentation of the -y and -p options.
  * Made zcav support skipping blocks for faster completion.
  * Fixed the autoconf checks for 64bit seek.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 19 Aug 2008 18:36:08 +1000

bonnie++ (1.93d) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documented the default chunk size in bonnie++.8.

  * Added support for testing write speed to zcav.

  * Made default block size for zcav 200M.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon,  3 Dec 2007 10:18:00 +1100

bonnie++ (1.93c) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made it compile with GCC 3.2.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed,  8 Jan 2003 23:13:00 +0100

bonnie++ (1.93b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an error in calculating seeks, it used to add an extra 5 seconds to
    the test time before calculation and therefore under-reported the results.

  * Fixed the signal handling error on Irix.

  * Fixed <algo> check to work with GCC 3.2.

  * Fixed a bug where it would SEGV if you specified more than 999 directories
    (now it handles 99,999 and displays an error message if you ask for more).

  * Fixed a bug in error handling during a stat test with multiple directories.

  * Fixed the mandir for RPM package building.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed,  1 Jan 2003 18:02:00 +0100

bonnie++ (1.93a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the signal handler extern "C".

  * Updated the RPM packaging.

  * Improved the NT portability code.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri,  1 Mar 2002 17:28:00 +0100

bonnie++ (1.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to latest debian standards version and follow the latest Debian
    policy on stripping and debug generation.

  * Removed optind=0 because it caused problems on BSD.

  * Added new test program getc_putc for per char IO.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun,  9 Dec 2001 15:52:00 +0100

bonnie++ (1.92b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a buffer overflow in the random number management code.

  * Fixed a bug where bonnie++ would SEGV if ^C was pressed at the start of the
    file creation tests.
 
  * Clarified the -r option to bonnie++ in the man page.

  * Finished adding the support for specifying the seed.  Fixed the bon_csv2*
    programs and their documentation.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 7 Jun 2001 14:03:54 +0200

bonnie++ (1.92a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the -d option to bonnie++ work with relative paths.  Now it does
    chdir() to the specifed directory and proceeds as usual.

  * Fixed a tricky bug related to thread management which caused SEGV.  For
    some time I had known of the existance of the bug but I couldn't work
    out how to reproduce it.

  * Added a feature of specifying the random number seed for repeatable tests.
    Also made a separate class to manage all random numbers as part of this.

  * Made bonnie++ have the facility to read from a file containing random
    numbers and created a program to generate them.

  * Added a "make dep" rule and include it's output in the archive.

  * Now I don't use stupid macro names like _close which break on BSD!

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 11 Jun 2001 13:39:36 +0200

bonnie++ (1.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the per-byte code use read() and write() instead of putc() and getc().
    Using the stream functions gives too much variance and isn't as interesting
    nowadays.  I will soon add a separate benchmark for streams vs write() for
    byte at a time.

  * Made it use a single file >2G on systems that have LFS support.  On systems
    that lack it there will be no more support of more than 2G of data.
    I believe that now any machine with 1G of RAM should have LFS support!
    Note that the ./configure test for this takes ages on ReiserFS.

  * Made it remove the ./configure cache files before Debian package build.
    This fixes the problems with incorrect data being cached for ports.

  * Fixed the memory checks for file creation tests, thanks to
    Andreas Dilger <adilger@turbolinux.com> .

  * Fixed a minor field alignment bug in bon_csv2html.

  * Made bon_csv2html not display columns that contain no data.

  * Fixed a bug where bon_csv2html could crash on bad data.

  * Fixed a bug where bonnie++ would generate bad CSV data if run with "-n0".

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri, 11 May 2001 16:34:58 +0100

bonnie++ (1.91c) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now compiles with GCC 3.0.

  * Stopped it giving a SIGFPE on Alpha and tidied up the relevant code in the
    results printing.

  * Fixed the CSV output.

  * Fixed a minor warning.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 16 Apr 2001 18:49:03 +0100

bonnie++ (1.91b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an fflush(NULL) to the Sync code to make it display the prompt on
    buffered devices.

  * Added autoconf check for snprintf().

  * Fixed some minor warnings.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 6 Mar 2001 20:17:17 +0100

bonnie++ (1.91a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the -p/-y options.

  * Made -n take "k" suffix for kilobytes for the size and the "m" suffix
    for creating millions of files.  Also allow specifying the chunk size
    for small file tests.

  * Changed readme.html to make it more up to date.

  * Made it conflict/provide/replace the bonnie package.  Bonnie++ does
    everything that bonnie does and fixes some bugs including doing srand()
    after fork(), and having sensible defaults and detection of RAM installed
    to avoid meaningless test results.
    There is no need to have bonnie and bonnie++ installed.

  * Use @exec_prefix@ in autoconf for better standards compliance.

  * Made it possible to specify chunk_size for IO and file tests separately.
    Added a new field in position 21 in the csv file to record this.  So I
    changed the compatibility number for the bon_csv2* programs.

  * Removed the "wait" code in zcav which caused all the broken-ness.  It
    probably didn't gain us much anyway.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 25 Feb 2001 17:38:49 +0100

bonnie++ (1.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the bon_csv2html bug that made the columns not line up if different
    rows had different numbers of blank columns.

  * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.90f which resulted in Random Seeks always
    being reported as 0.

  * Made quiet mode not tell you which UID it uses.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 11 Feb 2001 11:23:10 +0100

bonnie++ (1.90g) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added latency parsing support to bon_csv2html.

  * Fixed a number of bugs in bon_csv2html, now does colors correctly.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 6 Feb 2001 14:20:15 +0100

bonnie++ (1.90f) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now use mode "b" for fopen() for NT and OS/2.

  * Made the latency numbers print out correctly.

  * Added latency parsing support to bon_csv2txt.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 30 Jan 2001 16:00:19 +0100

bonnie++ (1.90e) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now should compile properly on NT and OS/2 (NB ZCAV still won't fully work).

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 18 Jan 2001 11:08:37 +1100

bonnie++ (1.90d) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated standards version to 3.2.1.

  * Done some serious work on porting to OS/2 and NT.  This may break compile
    on some versions of UNIX.  If so I'll fix it as soon as it gets reported.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 11 Jan 2001 14:01:00 +1100

bonnie++ (1.90c) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote bon_csv2html in C++ and made it assign colors to the fields to show
    how fast or slow the values are (red for slow, green for fast).

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 11 Dec 2000 22:31:20 +0100

bonnie++ (1.90b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added first stage of support for synchronising bonnie++ instances over a
    network.
    This required changing the way the -y option operates.
    Also created a new Sync class to do this generically.

  * Added code to check the latency of operations in micro-seconds (us).

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 5 Dec 2000 17:04:27 +0100

bonnie++ (1.90a) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the start of the new 2.00 series of Bonnie++.  The aim is to do
    serious performance testing of RAID arrays.  All programs will be multi-
    threaded.

  * Added the multi-threaded zcav that I had removed from the 1.00 series and
    make Bonnie++ use threads instead of fork().  Next step is to add extra
    concurency through threads.

  * Changed the format of the csv files.  Added a format version number and a
    place for the version of Bonnie++ that created the data.  Made the
    bon_csv2txt and bon_csv2html programs understand the new format.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 29 Nov 2000 23:53:13 +0100

bonnie++ (1.00f) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the bugs in timing of seeks.

  * Changed the number of seeks from 8000 to 8192.

  * Now the minimum time for a test that will be considered valid is 500ms (for
    bonnie++ and zcav), it was previously 1000ms but I have been convinced that
    system clocks are accurate enough for this.

  * Changed the default number of files created for file creation tests from
    30K to 16K, this change makes the test time bearable on obsolete file
    systems like UFS but relies on the above change to work on ReiserFS on
    Pentium4 class CPUs.

  * Changed the default file size to 300M for IO tests, this reflects the
    increase in RAM sizes over the last year.

  * Added some more compile warnings and fixed some more trivial bugs.

  * Made the loops: line in zcav output always be prefixed by a '#' for a
    gnuplot comment.

  * Made zcav correctly display the position in megabytes instead of block-size
    units.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 27 Nov 2000 09:45:30 +0100

bonnie++ (1.00e) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now exit on sync errors.

  * When directory can't be synced it will display one warning and not try to
    sync again.

  * Stopped it crashing when there is only one directory to be synced.

  * Made the version number managed by autoconf so I don't release it with
    inconsistant version numbers again!

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 9 Nov 2000 03:26:15 +0100

bonnie++ (1.00d) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use SA_RESETHAND instead of SA_ONESHOT for the benefit of Solaris.

  * Added a specific rule for bon_suid.cpp as it doesn't have a header file.

  * Added --prefix support to the ./configure , also made the default prefix
    be /usr/local instead of /usr .

  * Changed the autoconf support for checking for C++ slightly.  It should
    now work better for some strange setups and work the same for everyone
    else (I hope).

  * Made the autoconf tests for semaphore headers work correctly, now it
    should compile on *BSD.

  * Added --disable-stripping option for ./configure if you don't want binaries
    stripped.

  * Added autoconf checking for bool, now it should compile on AIX using ICC
    without any special options!

  * Reverted zcav to the 1.00a version and then added the code for -u, -g, and
    the fix for large numbers of data points.  The multi-threaded zcav code
    will go into 1.90 (the pre-2.00 tree).
    Bonnie++ versions < 1.90 will never again have threading code.

  * Made bon_csv2txt use every available character for the description.

  * Made it install man pages by default.

  * Added sun package support - "make -C sun"!

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 28 Sep 2000 16:22:15 +0100

bonnie++ (1.00c) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes:#53545
    Fixed in 0.99e, should have been closed in Debian BTS.

  * Closes:#53546
    Fixed in 0.99e, should have been closed in Debian BTS.

  * Closes:#61925
    Fixed in 1.00a.

  * Closes:#64995
    It is in /usr/sbin because it can only sensibly be run by the administrator
    of the machine, otherwise it probably will give bad results and may impact
    the performance of the machine in question.  Also it can now change
    UID/GID.  The new way of dealing with the running as root issue is in the
    next change.

  * Made zcav and bonnie++ take -u and -g options to set the UID and GID to run
    as.  For bonnie++ it is now mandatory to use the -u option when running as
    root.

  * Made bonnie++ not change it's command-line.

  * Documented the K and G suffixes for sizes on the command-line.

  * Now the CPU time field also displays as "+++" if the elapsed time is < 1s.

  * Fixed the machine-name broken-ness from 1.00b, and made the machine name
    default to the nodename as reported by utsname() (also the output of
    `hostname` or `uname -n`).

  * Now uses sysconf() to check the ram size, you can use -r to over-ride it.
    Also the default file size for IO tests will be twice the reported RAM
    size or 200M (whichever is larger).

  * Now Bonnie++ handles ^C from the keyboard, the XCPU and XFSZ (excessive CPU
    and excessive file size) flags and aborts the program cleanly removing all
    files when it receives them.  Also ignores SIGHUP.

  * Added AC_PROG_CC to configure.in so that it can compile on systems with
    strange C compiler setups.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri, 08 Sep 2000 08:22:47 +0100

bonnie++ (1.00b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more warnings to the compile and removed assertions.  Made some
    trivial changes to the code (like changing variable names) to stop the
    warnings.

  * Fixed the memory management problem on bonnie++, these made it not work on
    IA64 (and stopped it working correctly on most platforms).  Thanks to
    Electric Fence by Bruce Perens for the discovery of this.
    The worst part of it was introduced in testing this version, so it only
    hit me and my alpha-testers.

  * Fixed zcav for large numbers of data points.

  * Made zcav multi-threaded to test multiple hard drives at once.  Changed the
    way it works totally.

  * Removed some dependencies on extensions to the C++ standard which are not
    supported in all compilers, also removed some trivial header file issues.
    These were found in testing on Tru64Unix.

  * Fixed a bug in bonnie++, it would go into an infinite loop when the file
    creation tests had a non-zero size.

  * Made bonnie++ work for block-reads that return partial blocks, now it will
    print an error and do another read for the rest.

  * Made Bonnie++ accept machine names up to 4095 bytes and not crash if the
    name is longer.  Previously the limit was 20 bytes and it crashed when you
    exceeded it.

  * This version is fairly experimental but I'm releasing it now because I need
    wider testing of the new features.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri, 25 Aug 2000 12:15:06 +0200

bonnie++ (1.00a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a 30 second startup delay when run as root.  A user lost some data
    because of running it as root, if they had run it as a regular account
    they would be OK.  I don't want this to happen again.

  * Zcav now displays an error if it can't read a single block.

  * Added some basic autoconf support which I will use to increase portability
    in future versions.

  * Now provides zcav.

  * Should compile with all old versions of gcc.

  * Fixed a warning on Alpha.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 24 Apr 2000 23:34:02 +0100

bonnie++ (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now include ZCAV in the same package.  ZCAV package should disappear.

  * License is now GPL.  Tim Bray agrees to the GPL for his parts, the license
    conflict was stopping me from putting ZCAV into the archive.

  * ZCAV reads through a hard drive sequentially and reports the IO speeds for
    different zones of the drive.

  * Fixed a few minor issues with the documentation, and put the test programs
    in /usr/sbin as they aren't generally run by regular users.  Also use man
    section 8.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sat, 01 Mar 2000 12:01:00 +0100

bonnie++ (0.99j) unstable; urgency=low

  * 0.99h core dumped when you didn't specify "-b" for file creation tests,
    fixed.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 05 Mar 2000 11:16:42 +0100

bonnie++ (0.99h) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a variety of bugs in the semaphore code which were introduced in
    0.99g.

  * Fixed formatting of output.

  * Added "-b" option to sync all writes.

  * Changed the semaphore code to make it more easily hackable for BSD users,
    it won't compile as-is on BSD at the moment...

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 05 Mar 2000 11:16:42 +0100

bonnie++ (0.99g) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now use getopt() for checking command-line options.

  * Added new versions of fork and semaphore code, initially developed for
    postal.

  * Fixed the message that's displayed when bad command-line parameters are
    entered.

  * Version 1.[0-8]0 will use fork().  Version 1.90 and above will use POSIX
    threads and include the concurrant bonnie++ functionality I've been
    promising for so long.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 23 Feb 2000 22:16:23 +0100

bonnie++ (0.99f) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "-f" parameter to skip per-char tests and semaphore code to
    synchronise multiple instances of Bonnie++.  Thanks to
    Christian Kagerhuber <c.kagerhuber@t-online.net> for the patch!

  * Added srand() after the fork so each child gets different random numbers.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 12 Jan 2000 16:45:28 +1100

bonnie++ (0.99e) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the operation of "-x" parameter (used to just cause crashes).
 
  * Made it cleanly exit under some error conditions where it used to crash.

  * Improved the bonnie++ man page.
 
  * Fixed some checking of command-line parameters.

  * Merged code from the OS/2 port, needs lots of testing...

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Wed, 12 Jan 2000 16:45:28 +1100

bonnie++ (0.99d) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added some more functionality. Tests hard and soft link creation.

  * Fixed CSV output of <100 seeks per second.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 21 Nov 1999 22:37:42 +0200

bonnie++ (0.99c) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs with big IO (fseek related) and include man pages.

  * Made it always print the CSV data.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 21 Nov 1999 22:37:42 +0200

bonnie++ (0.99b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release as a Debian package.


0.99
Files are created mode 0600 not 0777.

Fixed some bugs in 0.98 where the results from several tests were totally
wrong.

Now the random file code will take less CPU time when there are extremely
large numbers of files.

Changed the format of all the output files slightly.  Notable change is that
the percentages of CPU time are now rounded off to the nearest percent.  This
is because it's not that accurate anyway (results that are provably more than
1% wrong are not uncommon), and because I needed the extra 1 character per
field.  Also now it handles CPU time >100% properly.  This is for SMP systems
where more than 1 CPU is being used.  Concurrant Bonnie++ will return many
results significantly greater than 100% on OSs that work well with SMP.

Added a csv2txt.pl program.  The main aim of this is to display data well
for 80 column braille displays for the blind.

Added "-q" option for quiet mode (less output).

Now the "-n" option works on a multiple of 1024.  So "-n 10" means create
10240 files.  This change is to allow the output to display in the same
format and save space in display (who would want to test as a lower resolution
than per 1024 files anyway).

The -n option is now of the form "num[:max[:min]]" where max is the maximum
size (default 0) and min is the minimum size (default 0).  To simulate Squid
use a max of 15000 and a min of 300.  To simulate INN use a maximum of 4096
and a minimum of 512.

1.0 will be out soon!

0.98
Fixed a bug where the data size couldn't be an exact multiple of the size of
each file (1 gig).  Fixed a number of other minor bugs related to that and
added more error checking as well.
Changed the code to support up to 1000 files for the IO test, if each is a
gig then you can test a tera-byte of data.  Changing the code to have more
than 1000 files wouldn't be that difficult to do.

Use the new C++ type conversions.

0.97
I have stopped using cout/cerr and never plan to use them again.  They caused
me significant pain when trying to get it going on an ancient SGI system.

Also changed the code structure a bit to make it cleaner.  One advantage of
this is that there is now a "-x" option to tell bonnie++ to run the same test
a number of times (it's interesting to see the variance in the results).

Now use fflush() after writing each set of results.  This means that killing
the program unexpectedly won't result in results being lost.  Also fixes a
strange bug related to printf() on Linux which I am still looking into.
